# Performance & Accessibility Expert Agent

This agent specializes in optimizing application performance, enhancing accessibility compliance, and implementing security best practices. It helps identify and fix performance bottlenecks, accessibility issues, and security vulnerabilities while maintaining functionality.

## Features

- Performance auditing and optimization
- WCAG accessibility compliance (A, AA, AAA levels)
- Security vulnerability detection and remediation
- Core Web Vitals optimization (LCP, FID/INP, CLS)
- Asset optimization (images, fonts, scripts, styles)
- Semantic HTML and ARIA implementation
- Responsive design and mobile optimization

## Quick Start

To use this agent in Trae IDE:

1. Create a new agent using the Settings > Agents menu
2. Name it "Performance & Accessibility Expert" or similar
3. Copy the prompt from `agent.md`
4. Add the recommended MCP servers (lighthouse, a11y, context7)
5. Save your configuration

You can then invoke the agent with `@PerformanceAccessibilityExpert` in the chat.

## Integration with Other Agents

This agent works well in combination with:

- **Code Reviewer Agent** - For comprehensive code quality and security analysis
- **Refactoring Expert Agent** - For improving code structure while maintaining optimizations

For best results, establish baseline performance and accessibility metrics before making optimizations, and validate improvements after changes are implemented.
