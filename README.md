- When working on a Markdown file, use keyboard shortcuts to preview the formatted Markdown.
- If you suspect that Trae is not respecting your rules, just ask it to "check your guidelines and revise your suggestion" or similar.
- Don't run your chats forever. Trae may start behaving unexpectedly and you might need to reload the window.
- Use Trae's AI Flow paradigm to work both independently and collaboratively with the AI.

- It will miss things occasionally.
- It will make mistakes.
- Don't trust it blindly.
- Keep an eye on your Problems panel.
